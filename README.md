Market Simulator

The market simulator is a gamified version of two investors placing bets on the stock market. The game gauges understanding of risk and reward associated with individual stocks and how investors can manage a stock portfolio.

The game will be a player vs. computer game.

The program will generate random numbers (percentages) for an up or down day for a stock or any other asset. Thus, each stock will carry a risk profile in the program.

The game starts with $10,000 with the player and the computer. The player assigns a percentage value of the total portfolio value to each stock. The computer assigns the weights randomly to individual stocks.

The player with the highest value at the end of 10 bets wins the game!
